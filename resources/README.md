# Features

"The Crusader" implements a new skill tree with a total of 8 skills (like every other skill tree). The skill tree has a focus on healing the user and his/her allies, resource management and dealing [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage"). A melee character is typcally very strong against a single enemy and struggles against larger groups. This skill tree addresses that issue by offering less single target power in exchange for a weapon infusion ([Zealous Weapon](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Zealous Weapon")) that brings some AoE damage to the table. The skills are as following:

**Cure Wounds** (Mana cost: 14)

* Heals the caster and all allies of the caster within 15 units for 10 health, scaling with the caster's [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") bonus.
* The player is partially mobile during the entire spell casting animation.

**Rebuking Smite** (Cooldown: 20 seconds, Mana cost: 7, Stamina cost: 7)

* A sweeping weapon attack.
* Deals 1.5x impact damage.
* Deals 1.5x weapon damage.

**Meditate** (Passive)

* The caster is set in a meditating pose until he/she moves.
* Meditating for 3 seconds buffs the caster with [Burst of Divinity](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Burst of Divinity").
* Receiving the buffs from [Meditate](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Meditate") has a 100 seconds internal cooldown, despite the [Meditate](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Meditate") skill having no cooldown itself.

**Blessed Determination** (Passive)

* Restores 100% of mana spent as stamina.
* Each point of stamina spent gives about 5% [Burst of Divinity](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Burst of Divinity") build-up.

**Judgement** (Passive)

* When you expend [Burst of Divinity](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Burst of Divinity") to cast a spell, your primary weapon becomes infused with [Zealous Weapon](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Zealous Weapon") for 15 seconds.

**Wrathful Smite** (Cooldown: 40 seconds, Mana cost: 7, Stamina cost: 10)

* A leaping attack that deals more damage to wounded enemies, and instantly becomes available for another use if it kills its target.
* Deals 2.0x impact damage.
* Deals from 2.0x to 5.0x weapon damage depending on the target's missing health.
* The cooldown resets if the skill kills a target.

**Holy Shock** (Cooldown: 30 seconds, Mana cost: 14)

* A blast that damages opponents and heals allies.
* Deals 40 [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") and 40 Impact Damage to enemies.
* Applies 15 seconds of [Impending Doom](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Impending Doom") to enemies. Enemies already affected by [Impending Doom](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Impending Doom") will spread the effect to nearby enemies.
* Heals allies for 10 health, scaling with the caster's [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") bonus.

**Channel Divinity** (Cooldown: 300 seconds, Mana cost: 7)
This skill can be combined with [Rune Magic](https://outward.gamepedia.com/Rune_Magic "Rune Magic") to make vastly different effects.

* [Shim](https://outward.gamepedia.com/Rune:_Shim "Shim")

 * Adds 50 seconds of [Impending Doom](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Impending Doom") to nearby enemies.
* [Dez](https://outward.gamepedia.com/Rune:_Dez "Dez")

 * Buffs the caster with [Amplified Runic Protection](https://outward.gamepedia.com/Runic_Protection "Amplified Runic Protection").
* [Fal](https://outward.gamepedia.com/Rune:_Fal "Fal")

 * Heal the caster and his/her allies for 40 health, amplified by his/her [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") modifier.
 * Revives his/her allies if they are downed.
* [Egoth](https://outward.gamepedia.com/Rune:_Egoth "Egoth")

 * Buffs the caster with [Healing Surge](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Healing Surge").
* **No Rune**

 * Buffs the caster with [Surge of Divinity](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Surge of Divinity").



Some of the skills above cause status effects, and some of these effects are added to the game by this mod. The new effects are:

**Zealous Weapon** (Duration: 60 seconds)

* A weapon infusion that adds 5 + 25% of weapon damage as [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") to the affected weapon.
* Applies 15 seconds of [Impending Doom](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Impending Doom") on a hit.

**Impending Doom** (Duration: 15 seconds, ticks once every 1 second)

* A status effect that deals 1 [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") per second for 15 seconds to the affected creature.
* Multiple [Impending Doom](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Impending Doom") effects stack up, increasing the duration of the effect by 15 seconds for each stack.
* Summons a thunderbolt if the remaining damage of the effect exceeds both 40 and the target's maximum health.

**Burst of Divinity** (Duration: 30 seconds)

* This effect can be stacked indefinitely. Each effect has individual timers.
* Reduces the mana cost of the next spell cast by 7 per stack (before reductions).
* One stack of [Burst of Divinity](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Burst of Divinity") will be consumed for every 7 mana that was not spend due to this status effect. This number is always rounded up.

**Surge of Divinity** (Duration: 90 seconds)

* Doubles the build-up rate of [Burst of Divinity](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Burst of Divinity").

**Healing Surge** (Duration: 120 seconds)

* Doubles the healing and range of [Cure Wounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/136 "Cure Wounds").




# Is it possible to learn this power?

Not from a jedi, but I suggest seeking out [Klaus](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/2775/images/136/136-1610466050-2031884270.png "Klaus").
