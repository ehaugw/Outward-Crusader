# Summary

What's the purpose of "The Crusader"?

* Enable the user to play as a holy warrior with divine magic.
* Give the user a legit reason to sacrifice health and stamina on a melee character.
* Enable the user to play an all out melee character without mana, while still casting a few spells.




# Features

Please report bugs here: https://discord.gg/dJP24PRbeQ
"The Crusader" implements a new skill tree with a total of 8 skills (like every other skill tree). The skill tree has a focus on healing the user and his/her allies, resource management and dealing [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage"). A melee character is typcally very strong against a single enemy and struggles against larger groups. This skill tree addresses that issue by offering less single target power in exchange for a weapon infusion ([Zealous Weapon](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Zealous Weapon")) that brings some AoE damage to the table. The skills are as following:

**Cure Wounds** (Mana cost: 14)

* Heals the caster and all allies of the caster within 15 units for 10 health, scaling with the caster's [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") bonus.
* The player is partially mobile during the entire spell casting animation.

**Rebuking Smite** (Cooldown: 20 seconds, Mana cost: 7, Stamina cost: 14)

* A sweeping weapon attack.
* Deals 1.7x weapon damage.
* Deals 1.5x impact damage.
* Applies **Doomed**.

**Meditate** (Passive)

* The caster is set in a meditating pose until he/she moves.
* Meditating for 3 seconds buffs the caster with [Burst of Divinity](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Burst of Divinity") or [Ancestral Memory](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Ancestral Memory") depending on faction choice.
* Receiving the buffs from [Meditate](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Meditate") has a 100 seconds internal cooldown, despite the [Meditate](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Meditate") skill having no cooldown itself.

**Blessed Determination** (Passive)

* Restores 100% of mana spent as stamina.
* Each point of stamina spent gives about 5% [Burst of Divinity](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Burst of Divinity") or [Ancestral Memory](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Ancestral Memory") build-up, depending on faction choice.

**Judgement** (Passive)

* When you expend [Burst of Divinity](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Burst of Divinity") to cast a spell, your primary weapon becomes infused with [Zealous Weapon](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Zealous Weapon") for 10 seconds.
* When you expend [Ancestral Memory](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Ancestral Memory") to cast a spell, your primary weapon becomes infused with [Bone Shivering Weapon](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Bone Shivering Weapon") for 10 seconds.

**Wrathful Smite** (Cooldown: 40 seconds, Mana cost: 7, Stamina cost: 10)

* A leaping attack that deals more damage to wounded enemies, and instantly becomes available for another use if it kills its target.
* Deals 2.0x impact damage.
* Deals from 2.0x to 5.0x weapon damage depending on the target's missing health.
* The cooldown resets if the skill kills a target.

**Holy Shock** (Cooldown: 30 seconds, Mana cost: 14)

* A blast that damages opponents and heals allies.
* Deals 40 [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") and 40 Impact Damage to enemies.
* Applies 15 seconds of [Impending Doom](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Impending Doom") to enemies. Enemies already affected by [Impending Doom](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Impending Doom") will spread the effect to nearby enemies.
* Heals allies for 10 health, scaling with the caster's [Holy Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/221 "Holy Damage") bonus.

**Channel** (Cooldown: 300 seconds, Mana cost: 7)
This skill can be combined with [Boons](https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Boons "Boons") to make vastly different effects.

* [Rage](https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Rage "Rage")

  * Adds 50 seconds of [Impending Doom](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Impending Doom") to nearby enemies.
* [Discipline](https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Discipline "Discipline")

  * Buffs the caster with [Healing Surge](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Healing Surge").
* Default

  * Buffs the caster with [Surge of Divinity](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/Crusader/ "Surge of Divinity").

# Is it possible to learn this power?

Not from a jedi, but you could try speaking to the guy next to the alchemist shop in Monsoon, or the little girl next to the Wild Hunter trainer.
You must join a faction to become a **Crusader**. Your **Crusader** abilities will vary depending on your faction.
